The project is based on the design, modeling, and rendering of a virtual 3D graphic scene, with most of the physical phenomena involved (light source, rays, reflection, refraction, color, shadow, etc.). 

Practicing the refactoring process of the system design and code.

Developed a 3D scene with optimization using machine learning algorithms. Applied software engineering principles including Agile methodologies, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and Test-Driven Development (TDD).

• Hands-on practice in acquiring skills in a new problem domain and developing an abstract description of a problem
• Develop an understanding and evaluation of complex software projects
• Understand the basic mechanisms of object-oriented models and abstractions
• Understand the development from idea to code
• Understand and implement class design principles
• Develop an intuition for basic design patterns to address software design challenges
• Understand and avoid anti-patterns in software design
• Understand and apply Extreme Programming techniques which aid in Agile development: refactoring, test-first programming, and pair programming
